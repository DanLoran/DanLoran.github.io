### MelloDetect

A project I'm working on with a couple friends - the goal is to develop a convolutional neural network that can detect whether or not a skin lesion is benign or malignant. We are using the ISIC database and are currently in the early stages. I see this as a fun and potentially very meaningful project to learn more about computer vision models and work with some very cool people!
