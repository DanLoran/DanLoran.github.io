### Hanabi AI
The goal of this project was to implement an AI for the card game Hanabi using a stack inspired by AlphaGo. I worked with fellow students to implement the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm that our neural network learned from. As a group we presented at the UC Davis Industry Symposium and were able to show our work and results to members of the industry.

### Senior Design Project
The senior design project I undertook was to implement a lane line detection that operates in real time. I implemented a traditional approach to lane line detection using k means clustering and then worked with my team to train a model to detect lane lines.
